🧠 ResNet18-Based Bone Fracture Detection with Grad-CAM — Description

Uses a modified ResNet18 deep learning model trained for two classes: Normal and Fracture.

Allows users to upload an X-ray image directly in Google Colab.

Preprocesses the image with resizing, normalization, and tensor conversion.

Generates Grad-CAM heatmaps to highlight important regions influencing the model's decision.

Overlays the heatmap on the original X-ray to provide visual explanation of the prediction.

Uses contour extraction to draw bounding boxes around areas that may indicate a fracture.

Predicts the class label and displays it along with the visually marked image.

Saves the output image automatically for later review or documentation.

Helps in AI-assisted medical diagnosis, research, and interpretability studies.
